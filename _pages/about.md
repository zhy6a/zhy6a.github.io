#  About Me
My name is Hengyang Zhou (Âë®ÊÅíÈò≥), I‚Äôm currently a 4th-year undergraduate student at the [China University of Petroleum-Beijing](https://www.cup.edu.cn/), pursuing a B.E. degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology. 

I am also an incoming MS student (25 Fall) at Nanjing University, supervised by Prof. [Beibei Wang](https://wangningbei.github.io/).

My research interests:
- Neural Rendering
- Generation, e.g. Text2Video
- Multimodal Sentiment Analysis



üåüüåü If you are interested in collaborating with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email! 

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
